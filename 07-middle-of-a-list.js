// Write an algorithm to find the middle element of a linked list. 
// Note You may be tempted to add a length property to your linked list class. 
// The length property is not a typical property of linked list, 
// Therefore don't make any modification to the linked list class that is provided to you. 
// Also, finding the size of the linked list using the size() function and dividing it by half will not find the correct middle of the linked list. 
// So, don't use either of these approaches.
