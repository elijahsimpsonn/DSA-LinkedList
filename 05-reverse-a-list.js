// Write an algorithm to reverse a linked list. 
// The time complexity of your algorithm should be linear (O(n)). 
// For this exercise, notice we are not asking you just to print the linked list in reverse or use another linked list to store the value in reverse order. 
// Your program should reverse the direction of a given singly linked list. 
// In other words, all pointers should point backward. BONUS: Solve this problem using both recursive and iterative algorithms.
