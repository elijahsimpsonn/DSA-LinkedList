// Write an algorithm to find whether a linked list has a cycle (i.e., whether a node in the list has its next value pointing to an earlier node in the list). 
// For this exercise, create a linked list with the name CycleList. 
// Be sure to insert nodes in the list so that it has a cycle. 
// Then test your program with a cycleList function.
